    "- Implement two new subclasses, Circle and Hexagon, extending from the Shape class. Each shape should have a method to calculate its area and should override the print_something() method to print something unique for that shape. Follow the same structure as the Rectangle and Triangle classes!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new subclass called Ellipse that extends Shape. Update Your Driver Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constructor: Implement a constructor for Ellipse that accepts parameters for name, length, and width. This constructor should call the superclass constructor using super().\n",
    "- Area Calculation: Override the calc_area() method to compute the area of an ellipse using the formula: Area = Ï€ * (length/2) * (width/2).\n",
    "- Custom Message: Override the print_something() method to print a unique message for the Ellipse.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test the Ellipse: Instantiate an Ellipse object and print its area. Verify that the constructor correctly initializes the shape and that the super() keyword is used properly.\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ellipse Constructor: Use super(name, length, width) to initialize inherited fields.\n",
    "Check Order: Remember, super() must be the first statement in your subclass constructor.\n"
